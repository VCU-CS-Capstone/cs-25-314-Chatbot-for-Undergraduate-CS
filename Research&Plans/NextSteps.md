Next steps for this project include, but are not limited to:
  * Creating/utilizing an email that will be responsible for the openai and the apify account
  * Ensuring that the web scraping is being applied to all webpages (_currently testing_)
  * Ensuring that the json will prompt engineering is working.(prompt, format, question) (_currently testing_)
  * Creating a manager dashboard for easy maintenance
  * Creating an google doc/excel sheet instead of a config file (maybe include this into the dashboard) 
      - this would be mainly used where there are different instances of the chatbot for different VCU pages
  * Continue testing in an internal, more manageable environment
  * If information is going to be saved, in order to determine which queries arent being answered or arent being answered properly, then we need to have a safe and secure way to collect and retain that information.
      - this could also be a part of the dashboard but more security features would need to be implemented
