## Chatbot for Computer Science

*Below will be the detailed plan for implementation onto the VCU  website.

1) Python program that utilzes Apify for web scraping and RAG techniques for word processing and conversation functionality. 
    
2) User Interface: Add HTML to the VCU pages that we want the chatbot to appear under
  - Chatbot user interface will be in a container within the HTML page and will send message information entered by the user to the backend which will then query       the database using the chatbot to be implemented.
  - Also will populate the chatbot's responses to the user in the container
  - HTML code for the div:

  - Uses .js for fetching the text from the user-input and populates the return of the python program in the backend to jsonify the chatbot's response and repopulate it in the chatbot container
  - Uses .css for the design of the visual and user experience portion on the website.
    
3) Backend:
- See python code here <>
- Build python program that will be responsible for sending user question to NLP for processing and return of key words
- Use key words to query a database to find all relevant information (this can be improved with word embedding if we have time)
- Take the information that was returned from the database and format it into a conversational response, send to chatbot (user)
    - We can either use the NLP to format a friendly response or we can have templates and fill them in with the information because the NLP will end up costing money.
