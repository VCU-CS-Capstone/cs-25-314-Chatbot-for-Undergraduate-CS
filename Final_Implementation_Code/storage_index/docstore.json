Courses that expose students to cutting-edge content and transformative learning may be added and notification of additional program approvals may be received prior to finalization. General education program content is also subject to change. The final edition and full PDF version will include these updates and will be available in August prior to the beginning of the fall semester.\nThe Bachelor of Science in Computer Science is built on a rigorous, highly concentrated, accredited curriculum of computer science courses, and includes concentrations in cybersecurity, data science and software engineering. The program provides a strong foundation in the discipline and includes advanced study in several important areas of computer science.\nThe degree requires a minimum of 120 credit hours and includes undergraduate requirements, general education requirements and computer science major requirements.\nStudent learning outcomes\nUpon completing this program, students will know and know how to do the following:\nComputer science core outcomes\nAnalyze a complex computing problem and apply principles of computing and other relevant disciplines to identify solutions\nDesign, implement and evaluate a computing-based solution to meet a given set of computing requirements in the context of the program\u2019s discipline\nCommunicate effectively in a variety of professional contexts\nRecognize professional responsibilities and make informed judgments in computing practice based on legal and ethical principles\nFunction effectively as a member or leader of a team engaged in activities appropriate to the program\u2019s discipline\nApply computer science theory and software development fundamentals to produce computing-based solutions\nCybersecurity concentration-specific outcome\nApply cybersecurity techniques and tools to address cybersecurity challenges", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2060, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}}, "docstore/ref_doc_info": {"61d1b7ea-ebc0-4bcb-9904-24f105beb5fe": {"node_ids": ["53f8b0f7-3a0c-4a7b-aa87-42ff39167b04"], "metadata": {"url": "https://bulletin.vcu.edu/undergraduate/engineering/computer-science/computer-science-bs-concentration-cybersecurity/"}}}}
