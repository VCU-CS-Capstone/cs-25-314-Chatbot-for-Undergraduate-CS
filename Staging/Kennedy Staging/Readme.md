## Database
**10/23/2024**

*This folder contains the initial rough draft of a database.* 
Included in the file are two seperate impplementations:
  1) The first is a main table that has keywords, raw data, built in responses, and then the resource site.
  2) The second is a breakdown of the data into more normalized tables. (this implementation is not recommended as it increases query complexity and therefor query time). However, it is included as a test to see if this implementation was a feasible option.
